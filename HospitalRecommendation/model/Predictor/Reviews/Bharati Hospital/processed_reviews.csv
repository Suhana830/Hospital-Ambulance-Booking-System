1 star,"Third class grade hospital.
You will be questioned same questions by 5-6 people while admitting. File is most important than your treatment.

RMOs are least bothered, reluctant.
Security guards feels like they are
owner. During doctors round in pediatric ward only one parent is allowed to
stand. How can one parent take decision of child. And baby can be managed. They will come in crowd.

You keep requesting but staff is like VIP. Try not to visit again. "
1 star,"If had minus star will be rated alot changed after 2019 ,worst  hospital seen ,all there doctor are not doctor but student .
I was having  left hand shoulder pain which was server  they even can't diagnoise properly operator of sonography as such new that he even can't handle one old lady patient on songraphy room I waited over 2:30 hr for just songraphy . Even worst think no management and too costly Charitable should remove from the name of this hospital .

Worst worst and most worst think is that they have tie with badass pharmaceutical companies to sell heavy costly drug for every patient  who has minor pain or symptoms ,prescribed medicine will not get in any medical or rare chance

Due to the wrong medication got skin allergic  on same hand which was in pain. My condition is even getting worst due to heavy rashes on left hand ,no relief in pain but increased .

Due to which with heavy fever ,heavy pain in left shoulder and rashes had done salting work in it . Now straight forward admitted me into one of private hospital in locatilty .

Hope guys this review will enough who dones't have insurance or filty pocket or more and more money or else even upper middle classe will crushed by their bill, management and doctor Sorry I mean student doctor just for chair they sign in OPD and seat in their special cabin for so call lectures "
1 star,"Very worst experience  have faced in hospital this time and lost my father because of the negligence of the staff  . Twice or thrice in ICU there was not even a single staff , informed many times to the incharge but no improvement .How can they all went for the break at the same time.

Twice patients condition went to crictical and i personally informed to Dr at chanrge as no nurse or brother in the supprounding   though patient was in ICU.

Each day they asked for different treatment , we just asked to show the medical reports but they denied , not even single time they shown us the report file ,  this is totally wron as its rights for the relatives to know what r the reports and what will b the future treatment .

During admission also they wasted lot of time and not decided among themselfs to admit under which department . "
5 stars,"I was admitted in MOT for a surgery.

"
1 star,"Careless staff starting from parking. Visit charges and other hidden charges is so much higher. Do not refer to anybody. All government scheames is not devoped here as per government rules. Hospital is founded for money making only. They have no care about patient. They want only taking care of theire money. Intrested in money only.
I was admitted in hospital. Wrost experience from neurology reception dept. Mrs. Rupali Patil. She dont know OPD Doctor is available or not at theire cabin also. In face patil madam is sitting in front of doctor's cabin. "
1 star,I was admitted for surgery when I contacted office for mahatma phule yojna person told first do process then apply for scheme. When I followed it and did surgery and went to ask about phule yojna.. They are saying why didn't you fill form first before surgery now it's not possible to apply scheme. Shocking service 
1 star,"Writing review after 3 recent experience. The hospital is no more trustworthy, avoid going.
They unnecessarly make to pay more by giving false advise to admit or tests or checkups by any possible means.
I'm charged with 2k for govt approved child vaccine which should be free. Also they mandatorily take doctor consultation charges there even if it's routine child vaccine and you don't want consultation. "
1 star,"Worst experience , Dr are not looking into patients ans rely on their assistant to take decision.
Those assistant Dr to nor educated , we need to tell them what medicines used for what purpose .
Brothers , sisters Neglecting patients in ICU , and roaming here and there , taking break at same time.
Many times complaint to main icu in c
harge but no luck .. Bad experience. "
4 stars,"New multispeciality hospital has good facilities, good cleanliness, and diligent service.

Lifts/Elevators are very less and insufficient considering the rush.

Parking near the OPD building is an embarassing experience. "
2 stars,The hospital is good but the doctors are very trainees.Experience doctors also come to see patients according to their time 
1 star,Very bad behavior from lady mrs. Ashwini Tambe. She behaves rudly like no washrooms are allowed to 6 no ward relatives on 3rd floor. It's very bad system that she behaving with patients/ relatives. Such kind of persons will always works with bad habits. That they do not showing human being to other's in a hospital or any such kind of places. It's  shameful for our hospital that she doesn't allow to use washroom. But allow only for sleeping. Shame.. shame.. shame...

4 stars,Bharati hospital is one of the best hospitals in the area with all the critical medical facilities available for the patient. Hospital is easily reachable in and around katraj area. The hospital has medical and nursing College too in the campus. 
1 star,"It's the worst hospital .
They just want to charge patient unnecessarily and make money.
I visited this hospital for my granny for the check-up, doctor inform they need to do some test for that they are charging rs4000. I completely understand but for the injection they are charging rs8000.
As per the nurse patient was having internal bleeding, to stop that they have to give that injection. It's a whole lie.
If the patient had internal bleeding she wouldn't able to eat. (They haven't gave that injection).
Please do not visit this hospital.
The name says it's a charitable trust hospital.
No it's not they just want to money from poor people.
They have made this hospital a profit making organisation. "
3 stars,"BHARATI HOSPITALis a 200-beded, multi-specialty Hospital located in Saraipali town of Mahasamund District (Chhattisgarh). The foundation was laid by Mr. Viswajit Gupta under guidance of Shri Jaynarayan Gupta & Dr. Bharat Kumar Gupta with a view to provide cost-effective, high-quality medical services, at par with Corporate Hospitals for the general public.

Within a radius of 60 km surrounding Saraipali, with a population of about 10 lakhs , there is virtually no basic, healthcare facility. There are many situations where the local people have suffered due to lack of immediate, medical attention or regular and timely monitoring. This was frequently happening on account of distance, non-availability of transportation, lack of healthcare facilities and financial inability to access emergency health facilities. We have now attempted to mitigate this problem by providing healthcare services to the under-served surroundings of SARAIPALI, for all sections, with proper infrastructure, equipment, skilled and experienced doctors and paramedical staff.

Bharati Hospitalis ideally located in the heart of the Saraipali town and is easily accessible to the neighboring areas. The Hospital is equipped with the latest, hi-tech, precision instruments, modern infrastructure, good trauma and critical-care facilitdical students are giving treatment to patient and doing experiments with patients. Very bad experience with staff and doctors.

1 star,"Be Careful. His Modus Operandi is to propose 3 hospital for delivery on Xerox paper very lightly printed where he can execute his crime of Cesarian with his partner in crime.

1 star,"One number is a wasteful hospital..Doctors are good but the staff is rubbish..Billing section people ask to pay 10 times deposit before admitting..People make requests but they don't show any mercy..Main building billing department considers itself the owner of the hospital. Spacial is a woman who considers herself to be very oversmart. General ward patients are charged with ICU. 10 thousand a day bill for covid and give only 2 pills a day. If the patient is discharged today, they call him back tomorrow and ask him to admit him again. Not talking about mediclaim.. There are some doctors who can't spell medicine correctly. 10 After going through the medical, I realized that the spelling is wrong. They are just sitting to collect money. The staff does not have the sense to speak properly at all.

This hospital, built by Kadam Saheb with so much effort, is becoming infamous because of this rude staff. "
