5 stars,"This hospital is best which I've ever seen. Dr. Rahul Birajdar Sir is just awesome. All the hospital staff is best including IPD, OPD, Reception, Sisters, Maushi, Medical shop. They take of your patient very carefully. No needs to rush for bringing medicines as they have their own medical shop in IPD area and you will get discount on all medicines. Clean and hygiene area, availability of parking, fresh and airy atmosphere. Also rates are very reasonable. I personally appreciate Dr. Rahul Sir because they explain our each and every doubts in details. Perfect diagnosis. Also they have their own pathology lab, ICU beds. Thx a lot to #TeamAnujaHospital and best wishes for future. "

5 stars,"Dr Rahul Birajdar sir and The complete staff in Anuja hospital are best. Best part which I specially like is the way they treat their patient is the best. Me and my wife spent 7 days at Anuja hospital for covid treatment but never felt that we are alone and no one is helping out. They took best care of me and my wife. Even after when my father and my brother was got affected by covid 2 months before so they both also got very good treatment from Dr.Rahul sir at Anuja hospital. All my family members are thanking you Dr. Rahul Sir and complete staff of Anuja hospital.
Thanks for all the support and care Anuja hospital has shown...! "
