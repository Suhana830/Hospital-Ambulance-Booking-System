5 stars,"For the last four years, I have been doing dialysis at Deoyani Hospital. The dialysis was covered under Mahatma Phule Jan Aarogya Yojana. I have not spent a single rupee for all my dialysis sessions. In the COVID times too, the dialysis unit was running continuously and special mention to Dr Limaye sir who has continued the unit and hospital for all the patients. The entire dialysis and the admin staff were very helpful too. The have helped us a lot for renewal the schemes and also in all our emergency situations. I definitely recommend ""Deoyani Hospital"" for all the medical treatments and other emergencies. Thanks! "

1 star,"Actually doesn't deserve even 1 star.. hopeless and ridiculous attitude of the Owner Dr Limaye and his subordinates. This HOD doesn't know there is something called as ' counseling of patient's attendees'
He is such a ignorant person and  the attitude he is carrying definitely doesn't suit a doctor...
I bet that he doesn't understand the meaning of
"" vidya vinayen shobhate ""
I.e Knowledge Shines through Humbleness
The staff in ICU and floor are equally bad. I think they even don't know that it's called ""Intensive Care Unit"".
An inferior and substandard quality hospital which gives you a miserable and pitiable experience.

5 stars,Deoyani is a good hospital in Kothrud. Few months ago my father was admitted and operated here for Bypass surgery (CABG). The surgery was successful with the grace of doctors and staff. The cleanliness maintained in the hospital was good. The staff members and doctors of the hospital was so good and Responsive. The ICU ward was great with all necessary equipments and staff's. Overall it was good experience. 
5 stars,Nice hospital with the best staff and expert doctors and peaceful environment. Do visit for best treatment

1 star,"Hospital managment gave very 3rd Class service.

I put the tiffin for my patient on RECEPTION COUNTER. but tiffin could not get to patient.
The hospital staff had eaten it.

When i had gone to managment that time management behavior was VERY 3RD class. They don't listen what i am saying. And just say we are not responsible for that.

This is very bad thing to take the bite of food from patient meal.

This 3rd class and kind of behavior not expected.

DEOYANI HOSPITAL very thankful to you for given this kind of service. "
5 stars,"Very good hospital, doctor's and staffs "
5 stars,"Hello to ALL..
This experience is regarding COVID vaccination team and services. Very nice set up and helpful staff. Also very efficient and ready to share information.
We are quite satisfied. Our Best Wishes.. "
5 stars,"Very competent doctors and staff.. Dr. Shrirang Limaye has treated my father very well. Entire hospital staff is very cooperative and gave us homely feeling.
Will always recommend Deoyani Hospital.. "
1 star,I will not recommend this to anyone. Very bad experience. I visited here to consult for my father. Father had weakness they took us to scan center and ask us to sit there. After 1.5 hour when nobody come I went to reception and ask for any doctor. Doctor was there but attending other patient. I went to doctor and she directly ask us to test for covid without seeing patient. They took 500 rs just to say go and test for covid. Please don't visit this hospital. 
5 stars,Good facilities.nice hospital 
1 star,"I had a friend of mine admitted here for dengue. When we asked a junior Dr how are the platelets falling she said ""Jyada doubt he apko to Google karlo"" and stormed out of my room. On complaining we were told ""young blood he"" (i have young blood too so should I have slapped her out for anger?) #nonprofessionalism. No apologies till date . We paid 55k + medicines around 20k for just dengue treatment for 6 days #overpriced. Drs just visit for formality. There fees do not match there staff quality standards excepts for the cleaning staff. Not recommended for middle class people. Too expensive. Their non response on the negative feedback is their attitude towards the patients. #highly not recommended. "
5 stars,Bottom of my heart say thank you very much 
5 stars,Overall good experience and very helpful to the needy people 
1 star,They make you wait for so long just for a follow up even when there is no other patient. There is no attendant. They charge a lot which isn't surprising for a private hospital. Even with all that my injury isn't completely healed. More than a year ago's hairline fracture has started hurting which was treated for a good month. We expect full recovery after going through so much trouble in terms of service of the hospital. There are other hospitals in dahanukar colony which should be preferred. 
3 stars,"Sharing the review only on the visit to patient and the environment seen around. The hospital is clean and hygienic as it should be. Location is bit confusing, as there are very less display boards or rather not visible properly because of encroachments around. The place itself is located away from the main road making the place quiet inside. "
5 stars,Best service  good doctor helpful staff 
5 stars,Dr. Swapna Limaye is an excellent doctor who cares for her patients. Great experience at this hospital. Very clean and well maintained environment. Almost all required tests available under one roof. Experienced staff. Good parking facilities. Satisfactory service.

1 star,"This is one of the worst Hospital I have ever visited in Pune
I went to the Hospital with my old parents for pre Medical Health Insurance Checkup. As this Hospital is one of the registered Hospital of that Insurance company, hence I was bound to visit this Hospital.
Initially during the billing, the Hospital reception staff was rude and refused to accept the service rate chart of the Insurance company and asked us to bill as per their rate chart.
