1 star,"Doctors are good and cleanliness also somewhat good.

But quality of staff management is worst to worts I have ever seen. Behavior is rude. Seems like all are newly hired. Way of coordinating with patients is horrible. They don't even know how to operate the advance medicals devices. Really need to improve. "
1 star,Extremely poor management. Slow staff. Looks like the hospital or its facilities haven't been upgraded for many years. The basement floor is ridden with mosquitos. Was there for the vaccine and it was very poorly managed."
