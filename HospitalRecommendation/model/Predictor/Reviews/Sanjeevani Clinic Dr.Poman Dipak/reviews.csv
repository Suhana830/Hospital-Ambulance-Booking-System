5 stars,"Me and my family have received very excellent treatments from Dr Dipak Poman till date even when we were covid positive and in home isolation. He is very humble, a very good human being and a perfect doctor. We are very happy and lucky to have a Dr like him near to our residence. Thank you very much Doctor. "
