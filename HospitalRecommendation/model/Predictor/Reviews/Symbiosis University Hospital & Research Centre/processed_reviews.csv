2. Try and book early slot - I was booked for 10-11am but even at 11.20am they were not done with half of 10-11am slot people.
3. Or may be come in the last slot post lunch to avoid the morning chaos. They do not close until last person for the day is vaccinated. "
5 stars,"Well organized vaccination drive. Kudos to the Symbiosis team for such good management. The process is very seamless. You just need to take your identity card and appointment slip, and everything is taken care.
There are many volunteers who guide you in the process. All the social norms are followed at every step. "
5 stars,Thank you for your service and support. I would like to thank each and every staff of general hospital OPD. They are very supportive and very nice management. 
1 star,"Lack of practical knowledge...
Need to improve behavioural manners...
No time importance...

I don't suggest to ge there for any treatment, as they do trial and error on petient due to lack of clarity of disease. Doctors are not likely to speak to get complete history before going ahead for treatment. "
5 stars,Great and huge campus. Very well maintained. The location is quite scenic too.

1 star,"My review is based on my experience for the COVID vaccination on 22-05-2020.

My slot was between 11am - 12pm. I reached the hospital at 10:30 and as soon as I reached the entrance, I was asked to park outside the Campus. That means walking all the way inside from the turning outside the gate. Considering how huge the Campus is, I was surprised to see all the open parking places inside the campus and they still did not allow people to park inside after a certain time. What if someone has problems to walk/ any side effects after the vaccination slot ?

As soon as I reached, I was surprised to see a 1 KM line inside from the hospital entrance all the way to the backside of the hospital. There was no proper information about why people were in line or what was happening with the vaccination. Total Mismanagement. At 11:05 we were informed that 9-10am slot vaccinations are still happening. That meant that after 9-10, 10-11 would begin. Someone told us to collect the forms from the gate and there was no point standing in line. Everyone left the line and rushed to collect the forms. Forms were distributed only to 10-11, so again we had to wait there without any proper information.

I left the campus to go home for lunch considering I was in the 11-12 slot, but my friend who was there for 10-11 informed me that he was in line. I reached at almost 2:30 and was surprised to see that 10-11 slots were still being given. He was still in Line.

Finally at 4:30 there was some proper management and they started calling people as per token system for 11-12 slots. My slot came at 6:30 almost 6 hours after the scheduled slot. I reached home at 7:30 PM
So disappointing considering it was Symbiosis.

Apparently, there were 4500 slots dedicated for vaccination and only 5 counters to process everyone. No proper management, people having to wait without food. No Social Distancing. Only Disappointment. I'm surprised they were allowed to process so many slots. They could have had 2/3 centers across the campus to process so many people They could have had sign boards to explain everything. It's unfair to the people and to the staff. Also, considering we are paying Rs. 850 now, I'm sure Crocin could have been given for free atleast. Other centers are ensuring people leave in less than 3 hours max.

I'd advice to wait for some other slots rather than go here for the vaccination. Request the GOM to ensure that such vaccination centers are looked into. No need to slot so many people together please. What if someone in the 4000  people present would have been positive for Covid "
5 stars,The hospital is very clean and the Hospital staff and doctors are very good. Here I had no idea I was a covid-19 patient. I am thankful to all the staff and doctors in the hospital 
5 stars,"Please be there on the time mentioned in the appointment sheet its under the preferred time slot, I reached at 9 am whereas my preferred time was between 12-4:30 pm. Very well managed no queuing reach the security lady in the counter she would give you a pink form to be filled, fill in your reg no( number received in SMS), ID number (Pan , Adhar etc) , your Name , address. Pen provided but its always good to carry your own, the form stays with you and there is a token number written manually on the top right which when announced you know its your turn and then you need to proceed inside till then sit back relax and enjoy the weather and the relaxing yoga provided by the executive there on the spot!

The moment you enter show your appointment details, Photo ID and payment INR 850 carry change saves time ! Get the receipt head towards the OPD get the jab and submit the receipt to lady at the desk for your certificate (printed copy provided on the spot) and also you get the electronic copy updated in the COwin profile after few minutes,  medicines after the dose is option available on payment. You are required to wait for 30 mins in the observation area and thereafter you are free to go and yeah dont forget to get clicked !!!!! Jab done right say cheezzzz!!! "
1 star,"Worst experience in this hospital this is my second visit in the hospital...Dr are fine but the other staff is very rude with the patient they only make fool of us ... second time when I visited for lipoma treatment for my husband Dr suggested for some tests & the fun moment was we want for sonography the receptions staff said  you have been given appointment for next month just for sonography   so I do suggest not to visit this hospital  so you just this how many visits have to be done

5 stars,"An excellent customer experience. Streamlined token allocation that ensures no crowding or pushing. Excellent management of people flow, lots of payment counters for quick processing. Didn't have to wait for more than 10 min at any point except after the shot

BUT, there's always a but.
1. Total lack of signage for the location of Vax on internal roads. Please put prominent and different format signs for directions
2. Must advise that  certificate of 1st dose is required soft or hard copy. Not everyone may have ability to download it last minute
2. Only cotton swab was provided to cover the injected area,  a small piece of tape must also be put over the cotton swab to hold it in place "

2 stars,"Massive Hospital like a 5 star hotel, but pathetic food, pathetic staff, pathetic nurses except for one or two Doctors are not experienced and visits are just once in a day that too attitude is like they are doing us a favour. No facility of normal needs of a patients  no fruits no coconut juice no auto no taxi for anything and everything you have to go to sus village three KM and you do not get any auto or taxi I would recommend NEVER to be admitted to this hospital "
1 star,"Government given land for hospital but ,symbiosis taking parking charges from patients. WHY? "
5 stars,"Nice experience at the Symbiosis Hospital Lavale for my 1st dose vaccination . Walk - Ins okay ( please call ahead before going and check exact hours ) . Saw the Symbiosis Hospital campus & medical college for the first time . Quite impressive setup.

Last Monday, I got the vaccination done in this hospital.The hospital staff is very cooperative at the vaccination center.If we need Aadhar card or PAN card at the vaccination center then we have to carry it along with us.
The cost of the vaccine is 780.Take 59 for pill medicine.

After taking the vaccine, they also give you a certificate and tell you all the details when you have to come next time?

UPI,Cash, google pay. Phone pay Can you deposit money on any of these?
After taking the vaccine, there is a rest for 20:25 minutes.

Vaccines are given in the shoulder, so it is better if you wear clothes that are loose fitting.

The vaccination time is from morning to evening. "
5 stars,"I been to this hospital for COVID vaccination of my parents. Hospital premise is very clean and desciplined. Staff is very supportive and prompt. Good facility and easy process of handling vaccination and registration, especially for senior citizens. Waiting room are clean and following all COVID norms of social distancing and sanitisation. Would recommend it to others for safe places to take vaccination in future. They have both vaccines in stock. "
5 stars,"26th May 2021, Covishield first dose vaccination experience:

I'd booked a 10am-11am slot for first dose of Covishield at this hospital. I reached at 9am, the centre was not crowded. They had made superb arrangements. The process was streamlined, and they had a good amount of staff available who would help you throughout the process. I had to fill a small form which took 5 minutes, and then waited about another 10 minutes till my token was called. Payment took another 5 minutes. I was able to get the vaccine within 20 minutes of arriving at the centre.

Be sure to wear a t-shirt, or something that can expose your sleeves easily. If you wear a shirt like me, you'll have to remove shirt to take vaccine.

Overall, it was a great experience and very well managed. I would advise to reach earlier if possible. "
5 stars,"I'm hospitalized for Covid treatment. I'm getting best treatment. Doctors team is continuously monitoring  and in touch with all the patients. Support staff is very courteous and cooperative. Food quality, Rooms, hygiene maintenance is just awesome. Location of hospital is in outskirts but pollution free which helps to get recover fast. I don't think, so called famous hospitals in Pune City would able to give such royal treatment in this pandemic situation. But SUHRC is doing more than best. Many thanks to SUHRC and team. "
5 stars,Went here for vaccination in May end. The place was very well managed. Refreshments were available for people. Adequate social distancing was maintained. Ample free parking space available in the campus. It took us about just an hour and half to compete the whole process. 
5 stars,The vaccination drive is very well coordinated. They have volunteers at every step to guide you through. Good and enough sitting arrangement for people. They keep announcing whatever is happening. They also ensure your time is not wasted!
