4 stars,"I recently had to visit the hospital for a minor procedure, and overall, my experience was fantastic. The staff was incredibly friendly and accommodating, and the facilities were clean and well-maintained. I felt well taken care of and confident in the care I was receiving.

However, the one downside to my experience was the parking situation. Finding a spot was difficult, and the lot was quite far from the entrance. This added an extra level of stress to an already nerve-wracking situation.

Despite this, I would still highly recommend this hospital for its exceptional staff and top-notch care. Just be prepared to do a bit of walking or consider other transportation options. "
2 stars,Reception manages appointments based on no criteria. I was waiting for doctor for 1hr 15mins. Doctor comes in and  they just let go someone came after 1 hr with no explaination.

1 star,"I have a very bad Experience about OPD.
I was waiting with my 8 year old kid from 9.15 pm.
I was only patient that time and doctor was on round. During his return hospital persons added before me, case papers of their known persons who came after me. No one from them was emergency case. And my daughter was having 100+ fever.
Shame on thease people, who don't have hearts.

Overall the best hospital for all type of treatment. "
5 stars,Jagtap hospital has been providing excellent and essential healthcare for over 35 years now. The new and renovated hospital is extremely well run with both the doctors and staff being very courteous and accomodating. They have clean and hygenic rooms for all types of patients and state of the art operation theatres for various specialties. I have personally known dr. Prajakta jagtap for over 15 years now and you won't find a more capable compassionate and ethical doctor to treat you. The jagtap family have catered to the community by providing excellent healthcare for over 40 years now. The hospital lists in oas one of the best in the city with the top radiologist in the city working there. It's a family run hospital of the highest standard.

1 star,"Worst ever customer Experience,Have wasted my 2 hrs there for vaccination on morning ,they told me once 10 people will available then only we will provide the Dose and told us to share your number so that we can give you a call ,however no call happens , finally I had called to them and they told please come .again 1 hr spent while my turn came ,they told sir we need again 10 person for vaccination .being in to hospitality is it the the way to treat the customer?

If vaccine is not available then you people could have told us upfront so that I could manage to go some other Hospital.
