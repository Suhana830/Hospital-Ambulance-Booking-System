5 stars,That oldest doctor is very experienced and so humble. This hospital suits our pocket.... 
1 star,"Such a worst Dr. Ever she is very arrogant nd not helpfull. If the patient's health is not good, that's why he goes to the doctor but she is not giving positive vibes to the patient actually she is break down the patient "
1 star,"Worst Dr ever.
Because of her, me and my wife had to go through worst pain in the lifetime (I can't write details in public domain), that too twice. For that we'll never forgive her. When that pain went beyond our limits she didn't shown any empathy, she actually didn't show up.
We waited at closed gate and tried to call her, she didn't respond. Then someone suggested to visit another hospital.
NOTE: whatever positive reviews you'll see here are for her OPD only and not for admitted patients. "
5 stars,"We had a great experience with Dr Rekha Kulkarni Mam,she is extremely Good and understanding, rather than prescribing loads of medicines, she is more focused on making the patient understand the underlying issue, ready to answer all your questions and happy to answer all your doubts . I would definitely recommend everyone to consult her, without thinking twice. "
