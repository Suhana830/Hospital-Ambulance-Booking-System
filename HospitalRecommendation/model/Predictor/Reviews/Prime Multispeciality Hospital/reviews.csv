5 stars,"Went here for my booster dose of Covid vaccination the other day and sister Charu administered the same most efficiently.  Have never taken an intramuscular injection that hurt so less. Really, our healthcare system would collapse in a day if it wasn't for such efficient and hardworking nursing staff!! Also the duty doctor n the people at the reception were most helpful and courteous making the experience of the visit much better 😀 👍- Dr. Meherzad Boomla "
1 star,"I went here to get the booster dose of the COVID-19 vaccine on December 11, 2022, and my experience was horrible. First, the nursing staff overcharged for the vaccine and provided no receipt. Second, they did not record that the vaccine had been administered, as a result of which, the certificate on CoWIN portal was not generated even two weeks later. Thirdly, when I went to enquire about the certificate, the nurse blatantly lied that she had not administered the vaccine and instead of taking action, Dr. Kunal Oswal defended her saying she was new.
Ultimately, the certificate was generated, but such poor service and lack of management does not translate into healthcare. "
