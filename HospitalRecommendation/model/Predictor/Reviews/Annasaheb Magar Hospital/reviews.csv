5 stars,"Very well managed. Staff is supportive. If you are planning to go for COVID vaccine 18 to 44, then get appointment and come by 9 am. Total time till I got vaccine was only 1 hour. Be patient, even if you see long queue, it takes hardly 30 mins to reach main desk. Fast service. Overall happy with service. For parking, there is pay and park behind the vaccination center, 10 mins walk. "

4 stars,"Annasaheb Magar Hospital is Pune municipal government hospital for all people.
All the mandatory vaccine and medicine available in.      low prices or free cost.
Good care of child and pregnant women.
All staff members and doctor are co-operative "

4 stars,"You can take any patient beyond 2 years here. There are no special doctors like ENT are available, but what can you expect in rs 10, this amount just check you and give medicines too. "

1 star,"Staff of this hospital has not vaccinated my 10 months baby, just because I am outsider.. They neither told any reason nor hearing my words.. Just harshly said go and get vaccine in private hospital.. Such a ridiculous experience of government hospital in the state like Maharashtra and city like pune.. 😌 … "

1 star,"I visited today for vaccination in 18-44 group .
I have booked online slot between 9-11 AM but when I went there it looks like you come in the walk In it seems all slots people have come at one time and space is very limited so obviously no social distancing can be maintained.It is not managed properly space is also less they should not allow to give 500 doses in a day if they can not maintain proper social distancing.
It took around 3 hours to wait in the queue.
However I have seen other facilities are managing properly "

4 stars,"As usual government hospital run by PMC.
Best for vaccination of child "

4 stars,"I got my first vaccination dose here (in vaccination drive for 18+). The process is well managed, and organised.
There were two queues. One for collecting the token for vaccination, and second for vaccination itself (token number sequence is followed for vaccination). Post vaccination, you'll have to stay at the centre for 30 mins for AEFI observation.
It is a small vaccination centre. Queues can be long, and one might have to wait for an hour. Carry water, and umbrella with you.
For social distancing, it is not solely hospital/govt's responsibility. It is for us people to maintain social distancing for our own safety. "

1 star,Such a management less people. Waited pregnant women for 3-4 hr. Don't have a system to check patient 1 bye 1. They said that wait otherwise go to private hospital.
