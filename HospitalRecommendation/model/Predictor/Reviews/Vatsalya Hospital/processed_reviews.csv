We strongly recommend her and also paediatrician Dr Anand Deshpande who took. good care and advised us abt baby sons  wellbeing ...Excellent  Doctors ..I wd advise you to definately go there fr  infertility , pregnancy and any mothet and baby problems "
1 star,"One star is also so much for this hospital. It should be minus ratings. This Doctor she charges 1500/- for any old records if we want from her, this is purely business. rest other hospitals they charge only 200-300 rs. And she is very arrogant to speak. "
1 star,Very bad experience. Though Dr. is very senior but still she cannot diagnose my ectopic pregnancy in time. Took lot of money in the name of tests and not provided any receipt. Now she is not answering the call too. Very disgusting. I will suggest don't go for consulting. 
5 stars,"Comfortable hospital, with all amenities, good doctors and excellent work by consultants here... I could conceive after 2 years of infertility treatment and very nice encouraging treatments and counselling given by Dr Meenakshi deshpande madam, who is an expert in this field... Thank you so much  .. "
