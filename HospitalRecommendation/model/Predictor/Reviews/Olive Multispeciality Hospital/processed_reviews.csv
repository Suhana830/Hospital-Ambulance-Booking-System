5 stars,"To be true to the experience out here had a very beautiful experience. My stay in dengue was very very good . Doctors are professional and specially the support stuff and the immense support and help at all times is very professional. It is not a place where they would want to extract money from you but will make sure you receive your due help and support altogether.
Had the best experience and was here for 5 days and Dr.Naseem is the backbone of this hospital and always a smiling and gracious lady at your service. "
