4 stars,"Visited twice for Mother & Son treatment. Both times it was a night emergency.
Every staff member from security guards, receptionist nurses, doctors is so helpful and cooperative.

Only pharmacists need to improve. The lady was so busy to check their system issue and kept us waiting for long. After work was done she was busy with her personal call...! "
5 stars,"Good Hospital . Good People

Had visited Hospital for Covid vaccination.  Found it very neat and clean and understood it offers various treatments.
Best wishes to staff and management. "
